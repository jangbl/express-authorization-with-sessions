## Role-based authorization

This repository illustrates how to implement an authorization system in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) that blocks a user who does not have sufficient rights to perform a particular operation.

We use sessions as a means to log users in and that's why this project also
requires you to run [Redis](https://redis.io) locally.

## Running this project

### 1. Installing Redis

Make sure that you have [Redis](https://redis.io) running locally* on your machine on its \_default* port `6379`.

This project assumes that your [Redis](https://redis.io) instance does _not require a password_ (which is the default).

If your local [Redis](https://redis.io) requires a password, please update the `db/redis.js` file to include the password field:

```
const redisClient = redis.createClient({
    port: 6379,
    host: 'localhost',
    password: 'your-password'
});
```

If you are on macOS, the easiest way to start up a [Redis](https://redis.io) instance is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

To stop [Redis](https://redis.io), you can run

```
brew services  stop redis
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run:

```
npm install
```

to install the project's dependencies.

### 3. Start server

Execute the `dev` script to start up your server.

```
npm run dev
```
